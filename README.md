# üê≠ BAR Keela Bridge ‚Äì Maintain Styling, Submit Seamlessly (at Zero Cost)

This small API project was built for **Beyond Animal Research (BAR)** to let you:

### ‚úÖ Keep the beautiful, styled newsletter form on your site  
### ‚úÖ Still submit the form into **Keela**, without showing Keela's default embed  
### ‚úÖ Avoid **any ongoing cost** ‚Äî no paid services, no server hosting fees  
### ‚úÖ Use modern tech & AI to research, test, and ship faster  

---

## üß© Why this exists

BAR wanted to:
- Keep the **clean Webflow-styled form** users already love
- Still submit that data into **Keela**, their actual CRM platform
- **Hide** the original Keela embed to keep brand consistency
- **Avoid any paid integrations** (e.g. Zapier, Make, or paying for Keela API access)
- Use tools that are modern, maintainable, and fun for developers too

So this project does exactly that, using:
- **Vercel** ‚Äì for free, fast API hosting  
- **NestJS** ‚Äì a scalable Node framework (and portfolio-friendly)  
- **Browserless** ‚Äì a headless browser (via GraphQL) that simulates a real user submitting the Keela form behind the scenes

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

1. Your Webflow form collects `name`, `email`, etc
2. That form sends data to our custom **Vercel API endpoint**
3. The API runs a **BrowserQL script** (via Browserless)
4. Browserless:
   - Visits the Keela form
   - Fills it out with the submitted values
   - Clicks the radio button and submit
5. The user never sees Keela ‚Äî just your clean design ‚úÖ
